          <strong>Automatically Collected Information</strong>
          </p>
          <p>Information about your computer hardware and software may be automatically collected by Lookscope. This information can include: your IP address, browser type, domain names, access times and referring website addresses.

          <p>
          <strong>Use of Cookies</strong>
          </p>
          <p>The Lookscope website may use "cookies" to help you personalize your online experience. A cookie is a text file that is placed on your hard disk by a web page server. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned to you, and can only be read by a web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you.</p>
          <p>One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience feature to save you time. The purpose of a cookie is to tell the Web server that you have returned to a specific page. For example, if you personalize Lookscope pages, or register with Lookscope site or services, a cookie helps Lookscope to recall your specific information on subsequent visits. This simplifies the process of recording your personal information, such as billing addresses, shipping addresses, and so on. When you return to the same Lookscope website, the information you previously provided can be retrieved, so you can easily use the Lookscope features that you customized.</p>
          <p>You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most Web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. If you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to fully experience the interactive features of the Lookscope services or websites you visit.</p>

          <strong>Designated Countries Privacy Rights</strong>

          <p>This Section only applies to Users and Customers of the Services that are located in the European Economic Area, United Kingdom and/or Switzerland (collectively, the &quot;Designated Countries&quot;) at the time of data collection.&nbsp;We may ask you to identify which country you are located in when you use some of the Services, or we may rely on your IP address to identify which country you are located in. Where we rely only on your IP address, we cannot apply the terms of this Section to any User or Customer that masks or otherwise obfuscates their location information so as not to appear located in the Designated Countries. If any terms in this Section conflict with other terms contained in this Policy, the terms in this Section shall apply to Users and Customers in the Designated Countries</p>
          <p>Lookscope is a data controller with regard to any personal information collected from Customers or Users of its Services. A &quot;data controller&quot; is an entity that determines the purposes for which and the manner in which any personal information is processed. Any third parties that act as our service providers are &quot;data processors&quot; that handle your personal information in accordance with our instructions.</p>
          <p>You may object to our processing at any time and as permitted by applicable law if we process your personal information on the legal basis of consent, contract or legitimate interests. We can continue to process your personal information if it is necessary for the defense of legal claims, or for any other exceptions permitted by applicable law.</p>
          <p>If we process your personal information based on a contract with you or based on your consent, or the processing is carried out by automated means, you may request to receive your personal information in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format, and to have us transfer your personal information directly to another &quot;controller&quot;, where technically feasible, unless exercise of this right adversely affects the rights and freedoms of others.</p>
          <p>If you believe we have infringed or violated your privacy rights, please contact us so that we can work to resolve your concerns. You also have a right to lodge a complaint with a competent supervisory authority situated in a Member State of your habitual residence, place of work, or place of alleged infringement.</p>
